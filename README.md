INFOGLOBO CHALLENGE
===================

This is a project to crawler RSS Feed and transpile to json format.

  --------------          (Not finished)
```
- Api Gateway domain
    - Api Gateway manager micro services routers
    - Api Gateway guarantee authetication if has JWT token
    - Api Gateway generate idLog and idReq for each request (this is used to tracker user requests and tracker request paths)
    - Api Gateway logger all input and output data and request status code

- Account Domain
    - Account manager user in database (create, change, delete)
    - Account change and delete need authentication

- Auth Domain
    - Auth manager token (create and verify)
    - Generate token if user already registered

- Event Domain
    - Expose database event's data 
    - Receive event data and create this in database

- Event Crawler Domain
    - Get sympla events
    - Send this events to event micro service

- All Micro Services
    - All microservice logger in /logs/requests.log

# How to use project
- Configure settings file
    Inside each project has a settings.sample.ini
    copy this and rename to `settings.ini`
    `cp ./settings.sample.ini ./settings.ini

- Start the project
    ```
    docker-compose up
    ```
- Check if all is ok
    ```
    GET in http://localhost:80
    ```

# Project URL's
- if you have Postman  
    Open the Postman.  
    In the top left of app has a `import` next to new, select tab `Import for link` and past this:
    ```
    https://www.getpostman.com/collections/9a2c45038c9ec2a30997
    ```
    after this, create environment for a project, and add these key/value: 
    `gateway` = `http://localhost:80`

- if not
    - Api Gateway
        - `GET /`
    - Auth  
        - `POST /v1/auth/login`  
        - `POST /v1/auth/verify`
    - Account
        - `POST /v1/accounts`
        - `GET /v1/accounts/my-account`     (Auth Require)
        - `PUT /v1/accounts/my-account`     (Auth Require)
        - `PATCH /v1/accounts/my-account`   (Auth Require)
        - `DELETE /v1/accounts/my-account`  (Auth Require)
    - Events
        - `GET /v1/events`
        - `POST /v1/events`                 (Auth Require)
        - `GET /v1/events/pk`               
        - `GET /v1/events/pk?origin=sympla` 
        - `GET /v1/events/metrics`          

OBS: All urls have a body validator, because this i don't specify body params here, after your hit a url you're receive a body params.  
In the postman url, all body params is present in saved urls.

OBS: to change password in `Account` use `PUT` or `PATCH` url and pass `password` key/value in the body.

# How to auth in the project ?
- if you have Postman using my project url
    - Create account in `POST /v1/accounts`
    - Get a token in `POST /v1/auth/login`
    - and be happy (i created a script in postman url to set `auth_token` every time you create a token ;) )
    - don't forget to try to acess a authenticated url

- if not
    - First step is cry 
    - Create account in `POST /v1/accounts`
    - Get a token in `POST /v1/auth/login`
    - Set `access` token in header `Authorization`, remenber to add `JWT` before the token
    - try to acess a authenticated url
    - OBS: All request need `Authorization` header


# Have you looked at the logs?
After run in the first time,  in the root of project folders it is created a `./logs/requests.log` look to this.

SPOILER ALERT   

all apps logger in this fille, and all logger contains idLog and idReq, idLog is unique browser id and idReq is generated every time wich user get a new url (however this last id is unique in all steps of request, is possible to track start point and steps in the middle of the requests)


- How this work ? 
    - idLog is generated by api gateway and save in cookie of browser and set in header['idLog'] of each request
    - idReq is generated by api gateway for each received request, and set in header['idReq'] of each request
    - for each request from a external micro service this headers is sended to keep request tracker

# How to run project test
1. use docker-compose
    ```
    docker-compose run (account,auth,gateway or rss) run-test
    ```

2. inside docker-compose (no need to download all dependency every time)
    ```
    docker-compose run (account,auth,gateway or rss) /bin/sh
    run-test
    ```

3. manually
    ```
    # create a virtulenv
    virtualenv -p python venv
    ./scripts/test.sh # this install requirements
    ```
Obs: `event micro services` and `event crawler` has test suit configurated, but no has test case, because no has time to create test's.

Obs: auth micro services has test suit configurated, but no has test case, because no has developed code, just third part apps.

All micro services has `/script/` folder this is a script to start, run test and deploy applications. all scripts is executable.

# Project structure explanation
- `/config` -> all app configuration files (not exist in node app)
- `/app` or `/src` is a folder to develop your code here, named `/app` in python and `/src` in node.
    - `/shared` is a code shared between all apps of aplication (reusable codes, middleware, interceptors)
    - `/app-name` is a self contained app, no has dependecy of another apps to work
        - `api_v*` is a folder to versioning api of app, used to more organization in the future when app has many versions URLs
- `/scripts/` each script of application, facilitators scripts, test scripts, deploy script and more.

OBS: In python structures, we try to keep django syntax, because it's the best known python framework, and it's simple to teach another framework to others people if the syntax and organization is similar.

# ISN'T READY FOR PRODUCTION
all apps are running using the framework webserver, for this reason not use this in production.  
configure apps correctly for production, has many tutorials in the web

# Another OBS
- TODO Attention -> if use vscode, i suggest to install `Todo Tree` in your IDE to see all todo's in the code.
- Python Linter -> use pylint and pep8 and set line length to 100
- Node Linter -> use prettier and set to use single quote
- Linters -> I suggest to enable format on save and dissable auto save in your IDE

# Future improvements
- SWAGGER -> ADD swagger in all micro services for mapper apis
- CACHE -> ADD cache on RSS URL, because it has static content throughout the day
- API GATEWAY -> Improve jwt validation (see a TODO inside `/src/shared/middleware/auth`)
- API GATEWAY -> Improve inputd data logger (see a TODO inside `/src/shared/middleware/logger`)
